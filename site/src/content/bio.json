  "body": "Solo Wit Luv (known as Solo) was born in San Diego, CA and raised in Atlanta, GA, where music quickly became the heartbeat of his life. From the very beginning, creativity found its way into his hands—he started experimenting with sounds on a PlayStation 2, using an app called Music Maker Pro. Those early days sparked a lifelong passion for building music that people could truly feel.\n\nGrowing up, Solo honed his ear and sense of rhythm while DJing weddings and parties alongside his father. Those experiences taught him how powerful music could be in bringing people together, lifting spirits, and creating unforgettable memories. That same desire to create connection still drives every song he makes today.\n\nSolo’s goal as an artist is simple but profound: to make music that people can vibe to. His sound is crafted to give listeners a break from their personal struggles, offering them a moment to let go, move, and feel joy. \"If I can help someone forget their problems and just vibe—even if only for a moment—I’ve done my job,\" he says.\n\nHis confidence as a performer was cemented in an unlikely place: the set of Family Feud. During a taping, though not a contestant, Solo was asked to walk out on stage and act as host Steve Harvey to hype up the crowd. The rush of hearing cheers, screams, and his name echo through the audience flipped a switch. In that moment, he realized the stage was where he belonged—and that he had what it takes to own it.\n\nBeyond music, Solo’s purpose reaches into the future. His life mission is to establish generational wealth for his future children, and to use his platform to help eliminate homelessness and hunger in his city and beyond. Music is the foundation, but legacy and impact are the ultimate goals."
